  \section{The Problem}

  There are a plethora of high quality, free learning materials all over the internet. However, these resources are not connected in meaningful ways. Someone desiring to learn a subject must search do a lot of searching and researching before beginning to learn, unless they go to an expensive school or specialized traning program. Thus, there is unnecessary time and frustration spent when trying to scaffold self-taught curriculums to learn with.
  School of Block aims to solve these problem by incentivising users to learn, currate, and create content. The platform will be free for learners and other participants - curators, content creators, etc. School of Block will also have tokenized rewards to incentivize each type of user.
